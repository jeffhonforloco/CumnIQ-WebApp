CumnIQ Web App - Cloud Infrastructure Guide
Welcome to the CumnIQ Web App project! This README will guide you through the best practices for setting up, deploying, and managing the cloud infrastructure for this platform. The platform focuses on real-time communication and social interaction, built using modern cloud architecture.
Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js (for server-side), Python (for AI and data processing components), Java (for enterprise integrations)
Frontend: React.js (with Next.js or Create React App for SSR, if needed)
Database: PostgreSQL (for structured data), MongoDB (for NoSQL and chat data)
Message Queuing: Redis (for real-time messaging queues)
Real-time Communication: WebSockets for chat functionality, WebRTC for voice/video calls
Cloud Provider: AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure (depending on your preference)
CI/CD: GitLab CI, AWS CodePipeline, or Azure DevOps for deployment automation
Containerization: Docker (with Kubernetes for orchestration)
Tech Versions
Node.js: v14.x (LTS recommended for stability)
Python: v3.9 or higher (for AI and data processing)
Java: OpenJDK 11 (for enterprise features if needed)
React.js: v17.x or higher
PostgreSQL: v13.x or higher
MongoDB: v4.x or higher
Redis: v6.x or higher
Setup and Run Instructions
Clone the Repository
bash
CopyEdit
git clone https://github.com/your-org/cumniq-web-app.git
cd cumniq-web-app


Backend Setup (Node.js):
Install dependencies
bash
CopyEdit
npm install


Build the app
bash
CopyEdit
npm run build


Start the app (development mode)
bash
CopyEdit
npm run start


For production (recommended on cloud servers):
bash
CopyEdit
npm run prod


Frontend Setup (React.js):
Install dependencies
bash
CopyEdit
npm install


Build the frontend
bash
CopyEdit
npm run build


Start the development server
bash
CopyEdit
npm start


Python Backend Setup (for AI/Processing):
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
bash
CopyEdit
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate


Install dependencies
bash
CopyEdit
pip install -r requirements.txt


Start the Python service (e.g., Flask, FastAPI)
bash
CopyEdit
python app.py  # Or `uvicorn app:app --reload` for FastAPI


Java Setup (for Enterprise Integrations):
Build with Maven or Gradle
bash
CopyEdit
mvn clean install  # Maven
gradle build       # Gradle


Run the Java service:
bash
CopyEdit
java -jar target/cumniq.jar


Dependencies
Redis:
Redis is used for message queuing and caching real-time communication data.
Install and run Redis on the server:
bash
CopyEdit
sudo apt-get install redis-server
redis-server


PostgreSQL:
We use PostgreSQL for structured data such as user profiles and historical messages.
Install PostgreSQL:
bash
CopyEdit
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-contrib


Create a database and user:
bash
CopyEdit
sudo -u postgres psql
CREATE DATABASE cumniq_db;
CREATE USER cumniq_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
ALTER ROLE cumniq_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';
ALTER ROLE cumniq_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';
ALTER ROLE cumniq_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE cumniq_db TO cumniq_user;


MongoDB (for NoSQL, if applicable):
Use MongoDB for storing chat messages, media, and user interactions that require flexibility.
Install MongoDB:
bash
CopyEdit
sudo apt-get install -y mongodb


Environment Variables
To ensure secure and efficient app configuration, we use environment variables to manage sensitive information and app configurations.
Example Environment Variables:
DB_CONNECTION_STRING (PostgreSQL)
Format: DB_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://username:password@host:port/dbname
Example:
bash
CopyEdit
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://cumniq_user:password@localhost:5432/cumniq_db


DB_PASSWORD (for PostgreSQL)
Format: DB_PASSWORD=your_password
Example:
bash
CopyEdit
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password


REDIS_URL (for Redis)
Format: REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
Example:
bash
CopyEdit
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379


JWT_SECRET_KEY (for JSON Web Tokens)
Format: JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret_key
Example:
bash
CopyEdit
JWT_SECRET_KEY=mysecretkey1234


WEBSOCKET_URL (for WebSocket server connection)
Format: WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://your-server-url
Example:
bash
CopyEdit
WEBSOCKET_URL=wss://cumniq-websocket.com


API_KEYS (For third-party integrations)
Example for Twilio API:
bash
CopyEdit
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_auth_token


You should store these variables in a .env file in the root of the project. This file should not be committed to version control (e.g., Git). Add .env to your .gitignore.
Deployment Considerations
Shared Storage:
Depending on your use case, you may need shared storage for media files (images, videos) uploaded in chats. AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage are good options for scalable, redundant storage.
Use S3 buckets for media storage:
Example:
bash
CopyEdit
MEDIA_BUCKET_NAME=my-cumniq-media-bucket


Containerization (Docker/Kubernetes):
Dockerize the application using Dockerfile for both backend and frontend.
Example for Node.js backend (Dockerfile):
Dockerfile
CopyEdit
FROM node:14
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
CMD ["npm", "start"]


Kubernetes can be used for orchestrating and scaling containers if your platform grows.
Scaling & Auto-scaling:
Set up auto-scaling for your cloud instances (EC2, GCP instances) to handle traffic spikes.
Use Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) or equivalent for distributing incoming requests.
Continuous Integration and Deployment:
Use a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitLab CI, AWS CodePipeline) to automate testing and deployment of new code.
Ensure that after every push to the main branch, automated tests are run and the application is deployed.
Monitoring & Logging:
Set up CloudWatch (AWS) or Google Cloud Monitoring to monitor app performance, and CloudTrail or Google Cloud Logging for log management.
Configure log rotation and aggregation for efficient troubleshooting.
Other Considerations
Security: Ensure the app follows best security practices like HTTPS, data encryption, and secure key management.
Compliance: Make sure the app complies with GDPR, CCPA, or any other relevant privacy laws if handling user data.
